In this project, I was contracted by the editors of the food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to work with the UK Food Standards Agency's food hygiene ratings data. The objective was to assist the magazine's journalists and food critics in identifying locations for future articles. The project encompassed several key tasks:

- Modify the database by adding a new restaurant named "Penang Flavours" in Greenwich, addressing its absence in the ratings data, and updating its BusinessTypeID to meet the magazine's specifications.

- Remove all establishments within the Dover Local Authority to align with the magazine's preferences and converted relevant string values into numerical formats using the update_many function.

- Conduct an exploratory data analysis to answer specific questions posed by Eat Safe, Love, such as identifying establishments with a hygiene score of 20, those in London with a RatingValue of 4 or higher, and the top five establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by the lowest hygiene score and proximity to the new restaurant, "Penang Flavours."

In summary, I completed the project by setting up the database, implementing necessary updates, and conducting data analysis to provide valuable insights to Eat Safe, Love for their future articles and coverage decisions.
